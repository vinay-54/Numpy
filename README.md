NumPy Basics & Operations
This repository contains a detailed Python script demonstrating NumPy array creation, manipulation, mathematical operations, indexing, slicing, reshaping, and plotting with Matplotlib.

It serves as a beginner-friendly reference for learning NumPy through practical examples and outputs.

ðŸ“Œ Features Covered
1. Creating NumPy Arrays
From lists (np.array)

Zeros, Ones, Identity matrices

np.arange, np.linspace

Copying arrays

2. Array Properties
Shape, Dimensions (ndim)

Size (size), Data type (dtype)

Memory usage comparison between Python lists and NumPy arrays

Type conversion (astype)

3. Performance Comparison
Adding Python lists vs NumPy arrays

Execution time measurement

4. Reshaping & Indexing
Reshape arrays (reshape)

Indexing and slicing

Iterating with loops and np.nditer

5. Mathematical Operations
Element-wise operations (+, -, *, /)

Boolean masking

Dot product

Aggregate functions (min, max, sum, mean, std, median)

Trigonometric functions (sin)

Exponential (exp)

6. Array Transformations
Flattening (ravel, flatten)

Transpose (.T, transpose)

Stacking (hstack)

Splitting (hsplit, vsplit)

7. Views vs Copies
Understanding ravel() (view) vs flatten() (copy)

Reshaping as a view vs making a copy

8. Plotting with Matplotlib
Sine function plot

Quadratic function plot

9. Random Number Generation
np.random.random (float 0â€“1)

np.random.uniform (range floats)

np.random.randint (random integers)

Setting seeds for reproducibility

Finding min/max values & their indices (argmin, argmax)
